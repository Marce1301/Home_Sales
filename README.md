# Home_Sales
In this challenge, you'll use your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then you'll use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

The steps to complete this challege where :

1) Import the necessary PySpark SQL functions for this assignment.

2) Read the home_sales_revised.csv data in the starter code into a Spark DataFrame.

3) Create a temporary table called home_sales.

4) Answer the following questions using SparkSQL:

4.1) What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

4.2) What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

4.3) What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.

5) What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.

6) Cache your temporary table home_sales & Check if your temporary table is cached.

7) Using the cached data, run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.

8) Partition by the "date_built" field on the formatted parquet home sales data and create a temporary table for the parquet data.

9) Run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.

10) Uncache the home_sales temporary table and Verify that the home_sales temporary table is uncached using PySpark.

11) Download your Home_Sales.ipynb file and upload it into your "Home_Sales" GitHub repository.

# Summary

The first setup steps enable  to set up the Spark environment, install necessary dependencies, load data into a DataFrame, and create a temporary view for further analysis or querying using Spark SQL.

After that I created a series of codes using SparkSQL to get the average price of certain types of homes based on the number of rooms, bathrooms and sqft .

I used the cache function and I determined the runtime with the function time.time()

# Conclusions

By using SparkSQL to analyze home sales data we can derive key metrics and insights from the dataset.

Spark allows you to create temporary views of DataFrames or tables, which enables to query and manipulate the data using SQL syntax. 

With SparkSQL we can execute SQL queries on temporary views and this allows  to perform various operations like filtering, aggregating, joining, and calculating metrics on the data.

SparkSQL capabilities serve to  streamline process and analyze large volumes of data, calculate key metrics, and gain valuable insights
